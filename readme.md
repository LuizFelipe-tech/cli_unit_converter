To use the API, you must first call the `init()` function. Don't forget that to use the master database, you must pass the `connection_string` parameter (that is, `db_url`). Also, note that the system throws an exception if the inputs aren't valid. This architecture enables a paradigm shift in data processing. For more info on how to avoid breaking the build, see the documentation. The system saves the data eventually.
